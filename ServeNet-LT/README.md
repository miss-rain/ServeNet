#### Run code as follows:
* 1.Download mode file(.pt and .pkl) from [here](https://bhpan.buaa.edu.cn:443/link/EF86AC0735FE85790657248234749747). Make a new folder named 'model', and put download mode file(.pt and .pkl) into 'model' folder.<br>  

* 2.Download Bert pre-train model(.bin) from [here](https://bhpan.buaa.edu.cn:443/link/EF86AC0735FE85790657248234749747), then put download Bert mode into 'bert-base-uncased'<br>  

* 3.Run ServeNet-LT.ipynb.
